## What are Yara rules?
***https://archerint.com/what-are-yara-rules/***

Yara rules are: 
- rules you write and use to try to find malware in your system

How to use: 
- you create YARA rules to customize how you find what you're looking for
- can also be used to check emails for malware
- must be updated as often as attackers would update their malicious code
