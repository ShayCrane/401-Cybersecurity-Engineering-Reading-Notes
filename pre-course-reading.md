*The purpose of this document is to facilitate my learning of various networking security topics.  It is created for my personal use, and is a summary, including paraphrasing and direct quotes, of information found in the article(s) linked within.*<br><br>

## **Five Whys and Five Hows**
*https://asq.org/quality-resources/five-whys*<br><br>

**Purpose**
- clarification of problem or solution
- get to root cause or solution<br><br>
    - **Five Whys**:  "used for drilling down into a problem"<br>
        - **when to use**:<br> 
            - to push a team to investigate deeper into root cause details
            - use with brainstorming or cause-and-effect diagram<br><br>
        
    - **Five Hows**:  "used to develop the details of a solution to a problem"<br>
        - **when to use**:
            - to develop solution details for the current problem
            - use with brainstorming and solution-focused cause-and-effect diagram<br><br>

**Whys, Hows - How to Use**:<br>
*the article recommends using flip chart paper and markers, as this is typically a team exercise*<br>
1. draw a box at the top of the paper and write the problem or solution the team is working on.<br>
1. draw five lines under the box, one beneath the other, and number them 1 to 5.<br>
1. the team asks outloud "why" or "how" five times, writing the answers on each of the five lines.<br>

*note:  five is a number that is somewhat arbitrary, but it gives the team a firm place to start.  the team may reach the root cause or solution in more or less than five asks of the question.*  <br><br><br>

## **CompTIA Is Changing the Language Used on All Certification Exams: Hereâ€™s Why**<br>
*https://www.comptia.org/blog/inclusive-technical-language*<br><br>

The article states that CompTIA is working to use more inclusive language in its exams.  These changes are being made to the terms used to describe technical functions.  
- this was done through a month-long review by the CompTIA Certification Governance Committee, and finetuning is on-going. 
 
- some term changes have also been made outside of the equity and inclusion purpose, that describe technical functions in less metaphorical ways to ensure clarity and avoid confusion.  

*examples of inclusive tech terms can be found by following the link above and scrolling to the bottom of the article.*
