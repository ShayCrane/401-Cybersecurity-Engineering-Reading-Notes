A dedicated Risk Management team is crucial for companies of the size and scope to be targets of cyber-exploitation.  

The first of the eight domains covered by the **CISSP** certification exam is:
## 1. Security and risk management
The subdomains are as follows: 
- Understand, adhere to and promote professional ethics
- Understand and apply security concepts
- Evaluate and apply security governance principles
- Determine compliance and other requirements
- Understand legal and regulatory issues that pertain to information security in a holistic context
- Understand requirements for investigation types (i.e., administrative, criminal, civil, regulatory, industry standards)
- Develop, document, and implement security policy, standards, procedures and guidelines
- Identify, analyze and prioritize Business Continuity (BC) requirements
- Contribute to and enforce personnel security policies and procedures
- Understand and apply risk management concepts

### Risk management goals for infosec:
- have controls in place to support the mission of the organization
- decisions should be based on the risk tolerance of the organization<br><br>

**Controls**:
- Operational goals:  (daily goals); task-oriented: patching computers, user support, anti-virus updates, network maintenance. 
- Tactical goals: (mid-term goals); moving computers into domains, firewall installation, network segregation (dmz), establishing central control (in some cases)
- Strategic goals: (long-term gols); implementation of IPSec VPNs for remote users, integration of wireless technology with in-house security solutions<br><br>

**Planning horizon**
- the timing of the implementation of changes 
- these changes can vary in size and scope, and cannot all be done at once.<br><br>
