## Getting Started with Zap

<br><br>
Security Testing Basics
- Vulnerability Assessment – The system is scanned and analyzed for security issues.
- Penetration Testing – The system undergoes analysis and attack from simulated malicious attackers.
- Runtime Testing – The system undergoes analysis and security testing from an end-user.
- Code Review – The system code undergoes a detailed review and analysis looking specifically for security vulnerabilities. <br><br>


Pentesting Process
- Explore – The tester attempts to learn about the system being tested. This includes trying to determine what software is in use, what endpoints exist, what patches are installed, etc. It also includes searching the site for hidden content, known vulnerabilities, and other indications of weakness.
- Attack – The tester attempts to exploit the known or suspected vulnerabilities to prove they exist.
- Report – The tester reports back the results of their testing, including the vulnerabilities, how they exploited them and how difficult the exploits were, and the severity of the exploitation. 

ZAP
- Zed Attack Proxy 
  - known as a "man-in-the-middle proxy"
  
Using Zap
- ZAP has a desktop UI 
- You can run an automated or manual scan and interpret the results
- not persisting a session will ensure all captured data is deleted when zap is closed
