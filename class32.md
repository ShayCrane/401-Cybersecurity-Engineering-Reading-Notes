Malware analysis
- “The process of dissecting malware to understand its core components and source code, investigating its characteristics, functionality, origin, and impact to mitigate the threat and prevent future occurrences.”

- Capture the malware
- Build malware lab
- Install tools
- Record the baseline
- Begin investigation
- Document results

Types:
- Static
    - metadata, headers, embedded assets, and more
- dynamic
    - allows the malware to play itself out in a controlled environment while observing its behavior
- Manual
