**SOC 2 Trust Service Principles, as defined by AICPA**:
- ‍Security
    - The foundational security principle, common to all audits.<br><br>

- Confidentiality<br>
    - Protection from unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.<br>
‍
- Availability<br>
    - Protection that systems or data will be available as agreed or required.<br><br>

- Integrity<br>
    - Protection that systems or data are not changed in an unauthorized manner.<br><br>

- Privacy<br>
    - The use, collection, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information is protected.<br><br><br>

***TSC = Trust Services Criteria: a standard to check against when auditing***<br><br>

### **SOC2 audit process**:<br>
SOC 2 Type I<br>
- audit conducted at a single point in time.
- checks for design integrity that day/time

SOC2 Type II<br>
- audit conducted over a period of time, usually six months for the first audit, and the next a year after that.
- relies on "system of record" to compare current state to state at last audit or upon configuration.<br><br>

SOC2 Compliance:  best to implement as early as possible in IT journey, for example when the organization onboards its first IT or security owner.
- improves security
- strengthens company culture re security, creates good habits
- provides documentation
- facilitates risk management; probably reduces insurance premiums-- this is my own guess

SOC2 Policies: these must be addressed to be in compliance
- Information Security Policy
- Access Control Policy
- Password Policy
- Change Management Policy
- Risk Assessment and Mitigation Policy
- Incident Response Policy
- Logging and Monitoring Policy
- Vendor Management Policy
- Data Classification Policy
- Acceptable Use Policy
- Information, Software and System Backup Policy
- Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan
