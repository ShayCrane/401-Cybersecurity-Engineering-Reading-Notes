## WHAT IS PKI (PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE)?
*https://www.ssh.com/academy/pki*

<br><br>

PKI is an authentication technology that uses digital signatures of cryptographic keys that can then be used as an identity for the user. <br><br>

Uses of PKI: 
**Secure Websites**
- SSL (Secure Sockets Layer; "https"); TLS (Transport Layer Security) is newer version
**Auth. Users, Computers**
- SSH 
**Email Signing, Encryption**
-  S/MIME, using X.509 certificate formats
<br><br><br>

**Limitations**
- any certificate authority can sign a certificate for any person or computer
- limited trust is recommended<br>

**SSH's Role**
- an early pioneer in PKI
- proposed alt approach: Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI)
