**Amazon GuardDuty**: 
- a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes data sources, such as those included with various AWS services and non-AWS-sourced data.

- threat intelligence feeds are used to identify malicious activity within your AWS environment, such as: 
    - escalation of privileges
    - use of exposed credentials
    - communication with malicious IP addresses, domains
    - presence of malware on ec2 instances, containers

- produces security findings viewable in the GuardDuty console and CloudWatch events
