<br><br>


**The SOC is the hub for the security operations in an organization**
- it contains the security team: 
    - analysts
    - engineers<br><br>
- the SOC minors a given system for potential security threats with the goal to: 
    - identify
    - analyze 
    - investigate the source
    - report vulnerabilities
    - prevention via lessons learned<br><br><br>

***There is also apparently a Global SOC (GSOC)***
